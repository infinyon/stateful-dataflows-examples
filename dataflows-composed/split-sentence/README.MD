# Split Sentence

The split sentence `dataflow` uses composition to split sentences into words and count the number of characters.
The example shows how to import and use two functions from the same package.

The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `sdf`:

## Prequisites

* Build imported packages:
  * [sentence]


## Step-by-step

Take a look at the [dataflow.yaml](./dataflow.yaml) to get an idea of what we're doing.

Make sure to [Install SDF & Start a Cluster].


### Run the Pipeline

Run the pipeline:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.


### Test the Pipeline

1. Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash
fluvio produce sentence
```

```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```

Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:

```bash
fluvio consume words -Bd
```

```bash
Hello(5)
world(5)
Hi(2)
there(5)
```

## Clean-up

Exit `sdf` terminal and remove the topics:

```bash
fluvio topic delete sentence
fluvio topic delete words
```
