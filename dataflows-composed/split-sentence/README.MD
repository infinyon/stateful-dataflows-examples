# Split Sentence

The split sentence `dataflow` uses composition to split sentences into words and counts the number of characters.
The example shows how to import and use two functions from the same package.

The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `sdf`:

## Prequisites

The packages below are imported by the datafow. You must build them first:
  * [sentence]


## Step-by-step

Take a look at the [dataflow.yaml](./dataflow.yaml) to get an idea of what we're doing.

Make sure to [Install SDF & Start a Cluster].


### Run the Dataflow

Use `sdf` command line tool to run the dataflow:

```bash
sdf run --ui
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.


### Test the Dataflow

1. Produce sentences to in `sentence` topic:

```bash
fluvio produce sentence
```

```bash
Hello world
Hi there
```

Consume from `words` to retrieve the result:

```bash
fluvio consume words -Bd
```

```bash
Hello(5)
world(5)
Hi(2)
there(5)
```

## Show State

Check the counters `sdf` terminal:

```bash
>> show state sentence-words/sentence-to-words/metrics --table
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       2          0
```

```bash
>> show state sentence-words/augment-count/metrics --table
 Key    Window  succeeded  failed
 stats  *       4          0
```

Congratulations! You've successfully built and run a dataflow!


## Clean-up

Exit `sdf` terminal and remove the topics:

```bash
fluvio topic delete sentence
fluvio topic delete words
```
