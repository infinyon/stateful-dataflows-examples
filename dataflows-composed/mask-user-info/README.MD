# Mask User Info

The mask user info `dataflow` uses composition to mask Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in records. The example imports the [mask-ssn] package and uses its types and functions in this dataflow.

The following diagram is a visual representation of these operations generated by `ssdk`:

## Prequisites

* Build imported packages:
  * [mask-ssn]


## Step-by-step

Take a look at the [dataflow.yaml](./dataflow.yaml) to get an idea of what we're doing.

Make sure to [Install SSDK & Start a Cluster].


### Run the Pipeline

Run the pipeline:

```bash
ssdk run --ui
```

Use `--ui` to generate the graphical representation and run the Studio.


### Test the Pipeline

1. Produce sentences to in `user-info` topic:

```bash
fluvio produce user-info
```

```json
{"name": "Alice", "ssn": "555-12-1212"}
{"name": "Bob", "ssn": "123-45-6789"}
```

Consume from `masked` to retrieve the result:

```bash
fluvio consume masked -Bd
```

```json
{"name": "Alice", "ssn": "***-**-****"}
{"name": "Bob", "ssn": "***-**-****"}
```

## Clean-up

Exit `ssdk` terminal and remove the topics:

```bash
fluvio topic delete user-info
fluvio topic delete masked
```
